The following options have not been explicitly set, so using the following defaults:
- converter-options: (empty array)
- shuffle: false
- preferred-converters: (empty array)
- extra-converters: (empty array)

The following options were supplied and are passed on to the converters in the stack:

Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version. Result: version: *0.4.4*
We could get the version, so yes, a plain cwebp call works
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 1 binaries:

Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)

Consider setting quality to "auto" instead. It is generally a better idea
