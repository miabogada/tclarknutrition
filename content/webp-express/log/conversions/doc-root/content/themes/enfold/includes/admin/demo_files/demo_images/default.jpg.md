Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version. Result: version: *0.4.4*
We could get the version, so yes, a plain cwebp call works

Quality of source is 91. This is higher than max-quality, so using max-quality instead (80)
